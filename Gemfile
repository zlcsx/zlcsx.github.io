# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     这个是启动命令 bundle exec jekyll serve
#     解决方法是先在config中配置好自己的github-pages的地址，然后通过jekyll build命令生成_site目录，把目录中的tag文件拷贝到根目录下即可
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
